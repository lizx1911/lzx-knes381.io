# 👋 Dear Dr. John Holash!
This is a report about the Impact of Force Versus Cadence on VO2 During a Step Incremental Test.

## Deatils
The research question this study will investigate is: “What is the effect of force versus cadence on VO2 during a step incremental test?” It is predicted that if a high force and steady cadence variation of the SIT is performed, then the VO2 would be greater. This is because at higher forces, there is an increase of muscle fiber recruitment and activation which leads to a greater energy demand, and thus, greater oxygen uptake.




Thank you for you reading!
